Incremental Load Strategy

0. We locally have a data.CSV file

Creation of the table
1. From that file a database is created in the cloud, the rdbms is Postgres
2. Sqoop imports the 'PostGres' table as a text-file to HDFS 
3. An external table is created in Hive, pointing to the location of the imported file

4. Now, some new records have been added to the data.CSV file

Up-serting the new records
5. We upsert them into the Postgres table
6. Then, using scoop, we do an incremental load to the table in Hive
